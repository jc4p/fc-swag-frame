# Frontend Standup - Day 6

## Summary

Major UI/UX improvements and code optimization day. Successfully implemented designer-provided UI updates to match the target aesthetic, optimized component spacing and layouts, and completed a significant authentication system cleanup. The T-shirt editor (`OptionsShirt.jsx`) is now production-ready with beautiful styling, while the Sticker Sheet editor remains the primary blocker for full multi-product support.

## What was done today?

* **UI/UX Design Implementation:**
  * Updated ColorSelector to use full available width with responsive grid layout (`auto-fit, minmax(48px, 1fr)`)
  * Optimized CommissionSelector price breakdown layout to prevent text wrapping ("Platform Fee" no longer splits to two lines)
  * Enhanced typography and spacing throughout the app to match designer specifications
  * Added proper visual hierarchy and modern styling to all interactive elements

* **Component Optimization & Debugging:**
  * Added comprehensive debugging to CommissionSelector and OptionsShirt for price calculation troubleshooting
  * Fixed commission rate update functionality with proper state management
  * Improved button text to "Create Listing (Free)" for clarity
  * Enhanced price calculation flow with better error handling and logging

* **Authentication System Cleanup:**
  * Removed all legacy SIWF (Sign In With Farcaster) code from both OptionsShirt and OptionsStickerSheet
  * Eliminated deprecated `/api/auth/nonce` endpoint dependencies that were causing 404 errors
  * Migrated both components to use consistent `frame.sdk.experimental.quickAuth()` implementation
  * Streamlined authentication flow by removing unnecessary nonce pre-fetching
  * Updated publish button logic to work correctly with Quick Auth

* **Major Code Refactoring (from earlier today):**
  * Broke down monolithic OptionsShirt.jsx (~1100 lines) into 8 reusable components
  * Created shared components: ImageUploadHandler, KonvaImageEditor, ColorSelector, CommissionSelector, PublishButton
  * Extracted utility libraries: priceCalculator.js, imageUtils.js, usePublishDesign.js hook
  * Achieved significant code organization improvements while maintaining all functionality

## Blockers

* **Sticker Sheet Editor (`OptionsStickerSheet.jsx`):**
  * Still experiencing persistent Konva rendering errors from Day 5
  * Primary error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getParent')` from Konva Layer.add
  * Secondary error: `Text components are not supported for now in ReactKonva`
  * These errors prevent the sticker sheet editor from functioning properly

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 7)

* **Priority: Fix Sticker Sheet Konva Errors:**
  1. Create minimal reproduction case by stripping OptionsStickerSheet down to bare essentials
  2. Systematically debug the UserStickerImage component rendering
  3. Review all conditional rendering logic to ensure no invalid children are passed to Konva
  4. Test with different React rendering patterns if necessary

* **Polish & Testing:**
  * Complete end-to-end testing of T-shirt creation flow with new authentication
  * Verify price calculations across all commission rates
  * Test image upload and manipulation workflows

* **Multi-Product Support:**
  * Once sticker sheet rendering is fixed, complete the multi-image publish flow
  * Finalize product type detection and routing logic
  * Ensure both product types work seamlessly with Quick Auth

## Notes

The app is now visually polished and the T-shirt flow is production-ready. The authentication cleanup eliminated several pain points and 404 errors. The main remaining work is resolving the Konva rendering issues in the sticker sheet editor to achieve full multi-product support.
