# Frontend Standup - Day 4

## Summary

Successfully resolved the iOS image upload bug by refactoring the file input trigger to use an HTML `<label>`. Integrated a new background removal feature using the Pixian API via a new backend endpoint (`/api/image/remove-background`). Implemented the Sign-In With Farcaster (SIWF) flow triggered by the "Publish" button for unauthenticated users, including nonce fetching, calling the Frame SDK's `signIn` action, backend verification (`/api/auth/signin`), and global state management using a new `AuthContext`. The publish action now correctly uses the obtained JWT for authenticated requests to `/api/designs`. Action buttons (remove image, remove background) were updated to use SVG icons positioned near the selected image, which update live during transformations.

## What was done today?

*   **iOS Bug Fix:**
    *   Diagnosed inconsistent `onChange` event firing for programmatically triggered hidden file inputs on iOS.
    *   Replaced `.click()` trigger with an HTML `<label htmlFor="file-upload-input">` linked to the `<input>`, ensuring reliable file picker invocation.
*   **Debug Overlay Cleanup:**
    *   Commented out the `DebugOverlay` component in the main layout, keeping the context and component code available for future debugging.
*   **Background Removal Feature:**
    *   Integrated with `POST /api/image/remove-background`:
        *   Created `handleRemoveBackgroundClick` function.
        *   Converted existing image data URL to Blob for sending.
        *   Sent Blob via `FormData` to the backend API.
        *   Handled the returned image Blob, converted it back to a data URL using `FileReader`.
        *   Updated `uploadedImageDataUrl` state to display the processed image.
        *   Added `isRemovingBackground` loading state and feedback.
    *   Added `hasBackgroundBeenRemoved` state to track if the action was performed.
*   **UI Refinements (Action Icons):**
    *   Replaced the previous "Remove Background" circle and the separate "Remove Image" button with interactive icons positioned near the selected image.
    *   Used SVG strings converted to data URLs and loaded via `use-image` for the icons (üóëÔ∏è for remove, ‚ú® for background removal placeholder - actual SVGs implemented).
    *   Created icon `Group` components in Konva containing an invisible `Rect` for hit detection and the icon `Image`.
    *   Updated icon positioning logic (`calculateIconPositions`, `handleUserImageTransform`) to track the image live during drag (`onDragMove`) and transform (`onTransform`).
    *   Adjusted icon appearance (made white, increased padding). 
    *   Conditionally rendered the remove background icon based on `!hasBackgroundBeenRemoved` state.
*   **Authentication (SIWF):**
    *   Created `AuthContext` (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`) to manage `authToken`, `userFid`, `isAuthenticated`, `isAuthLoading` state globally.
    *   Implemented `login` and `logout` functions interacting with `localStorage` (`fc-auth-token`).
    *   Wrapped the application in `AuthProvider` (`src/app/layout.js`).
    *   Refactored `handlePublishClick` in `ProductOptions.jsx`:
        *   Fetched nonce on component mount using a `useEffect` hook and stored in state (`signInNonce`).
        *   If user is not authenticated (`!isAuthenticated`):
            *   Triggered `frame.sdk.actions.signIn({ nonce: signInNonce })`.
            *   Sent resulting `message` and `signature` to backend `POST /api/auth/signin`.
            *   Called `login(token, fid)` from `useAuth` upon successful backend verification.
        *   If user is authenticated:
            *   Used `authToken` from context in the `Authorization` header for `POST /api/designs`.
    *   Updated publish button text ("Sign In & Publish" vs. "Publish Design") and disabled states based on auth status (`isAuthenticated`, `isAuthLoading`, `isSigningIn`) and nonce readiness.

## Blockers

*   None currently. The required backend endpoints are available. Frontend work can proceed to testing and integrating with upcoming backend features (mockups/WebSockets).

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 5 - Continue Phase 3 / Start Phase 4 Frontend)

*   **Complete Design Submission Testing:**
    *   Perform thorough end-to-end tests: Select variant, upload image, transform, remove background (optional), sign in (if needed), publish design using `POST /api/designs`.
    *   Verify the high-resolution export logic within `handlePublishClick` generates the correct image data for the backend.
*   **WebSocket Integration Planning:**
    *   Review backend plan for `/api/ws` and mockup generation events (`mockup_task_finished`).
    *   Begin planning frontend WebSocket client implementation: Establishing connection, handling messages, updating UI (e.g., showing mockup when ready).
*   **UI Polish (Time Permitting):**
    *   Minor visual refinements to the editor controls (icons, transformer appearance).
