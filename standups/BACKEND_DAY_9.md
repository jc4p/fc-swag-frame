# Backend Day 9 Standup - December 6, 2025

## What I Got Done Today

### Fixed T-Shirt Color Issue
- **Problem**: All 45 colors were showing instead of the 8 target colors
- **Root Cause**: `import-product` endpoint was passing empty array for color filters
- **Fix**: Modified endpoint to apply TARGET_COLORS filter specifically for T-shirts (product 586)
- **Result**: T-shirts now correctly show only 8 colors: Berry, Black, Blue Jean, Brick, Grey, Moss, True Navy, White

### Added Product Images Support
- **Investigation**: Found Printful provides product images via their API
- **Implementation**: Modified import process to download and host images on R2
- **Schema Update**: Added `image_url` field to products table
- **API Update**: `/api/products` endpoint now includes product image URLs
- **Result**: All products now have images hosted on our R2 bucket

### Implemented Poster Products
- **Matte Poster (ID: 1)**: 16 size variants, all portrait/square orientations
- **Glossy Poster (ID: 171)**: 14 size variants, similar sizes to matte
- **Technical Details**:
  - Fixed size filtering bug that was blocking non-apparel products
  - Added default color handling (posters don't have color variants)
  - Implemented dynamic dimension calculation (no margins, full bleed)
  - Created comprehensive documentation for aspect ratio handling

### Documentation & Cleanup
- **Created README.md**: Complete guide for database management and product imports
- **Cleaned up seed.js**: Removed ~200 lines of unused code
- **Created docs**: `POSTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `PRODUCT_IMAGES.md`
- **Database Reset**: Full reset and reimport of all products with proper data

## Current System Status

### Products in System (5 total)
1. **T-Shirt (586)**: 8 colors × 4 sizes = 32 variants
2. **Sticker Sheet (505)**: 1 variant
3. **Kiss-Cut Stickers (358)**: 3 size variants
4. **Matte Poster (1)**: 16 size variants
5. **Glossy Poster (171)**: 14 size variants

### Product Images
All products now have images hosted on R2:
- Format: `https://fc-swag-images.kasra.codes/products/product_{id}_main.jpg`
- Downloaded from Printful during import
- Included in API responses

### Remote Database Status
- Currently has first 3 products (T-shirt, Sticker Sheet, Kiss-Cut Stickers)
- Posters tested locally, ready to import to remote when needed

## Frontend Integration Needed

### 1. Product Images
- Use `image_url` field from `/api/products` endpoint
- Replace placeholder images on product selection page
- Example: `product.image_url` returns full URL to hosted image

### 2. Poster Support
- Add poster options to product selection
- Implement aspect ratio detection for uploaded images
- Filter available poster sizes based on image aspect ratio
- See `/docs/POSTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed implementation guide

### 3. Canvas Dimensions
- Posters use full canvas (no margins)
- Use `template_width/height` for canvas size
- `print_area_width/height` equals template dimensions for posters

### 4. Product Type Detection
- Check `product.name` to identify type
- Posters contain "Poster" in name
- Both poster types have only "White" color option

## What To Work On Tomorrow (Day 10)

### High Priority
1. **Order Management System**
   - Design order schema (orders, order_items tables)
   - Implement order creation endpoint
   - Add Printful order submission integration
   - Handle order status updates

2. **Checkout Flow Backend**
   - Create cart/checkout endpoints
   - Calculate shipping costs via Printful API
   - Handle payment processing integration
   - Generate order confirmation

### Medium Priority
3. **User Profile Endpoints**
   - Get user's published designs
   - Get user's order history
   - Update user preferences
   - Artist earnings dashboard data

4. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Track design views
   - Track sales by design
   - Artist earnings calculations
   - Platform statistics

### Low Priority
5. **Missing Sticker Sizes Investigation**
   - Kiss-Cut stickers missing 2"×2" and 6"×6" variants
   - May need to check Printful API or contact support

## Technical Debt
- Consider caching strategy for product data
- Add error recovery for failed image uploads
- Implement batch variant updates for price/inventory sync
- Add comprehensive logging for order processing

## Notes for Frontend Dev

### Poster Size Selection UI
When user uploads an image for a poster:
1. Calculate aspect ratio: `width / height`
2. Use tolerance of ±5% for matching
3. Common ratios to support:
   - Square (1.0): 10×10, 12×12, 14×14, 16×16, 18×18
   - Portrait 2:3 (0.667): 12×18, 20×30, 24×36
   - Portrait 3:4 (0.75): 12×16, 18×24
   - Portrait 4:5 (0.8): 8×10, 16×20

### API Response Changes
Products endpoint now includes:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Enhanced Matte Paper Poster (in)",
  "image_url": "https://fc-swag-images.kasra.codes/products/product_1_main.jpg",
  "colors": [{
    "color_name": "White",
    "variants": [/* sizes with dimensions */]
  }]
}
```

## Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
- `PRINTFUL_API_KEY`: For API access
- `R2_PUBLIC_URL`: For image hosting
- `ADMIN_AUTH_KEY`: For admin endpoints

The backend is now ready for full product catalog support with proper images and poster products!
