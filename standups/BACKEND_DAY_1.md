# Backend Standup - Day 1

**Date:** 2025-05-02 (Adjust as needed)
**Developer:** Backend AI (Gemini)

## Summary

Completed all planned backend tasks for Phase 1 (Days 1-2) as outlined in `docs/DEV_TIMELINE.md`. We are currently on track.

## What was done today?

*   **API Scaffolding:** Initialized Hono app, set up CORS, and created stub handlers for all planned API endpoints (`/api/src/index.js`).
*   **Database Setup (D1):**
    *   Created the `fc_swag` D1 database via wrangler.
    *   Configured D1 binding (`DB`) in `api/wrangler.toml`.
    *   Defined initial schema (`products`, `product_variants` tables with appropriate columns including `size`) in `api/schema.sql`.
    *   Successfully applied the schema to both remote and local D1 databases (after resolving initial table alteration issue).
*   **Printful Integration & Seeding:**
    *   Implemented helper functions to interact with Printful API v2 (`api/src/printful.js`) for fetching products, variants, and availability.
    *   Created core seeding logic (`api/src/seed.js`) to fetch data for a specific Printful product (ID 586), filter variants by specified colors and DTG technique, check availability, and populate the `products` and `product_variants` tables in D1.
    *   Added a temporary admin endpoint (`POST /api/admin/seed-product`) to trigger the seeding process.
*   **Authentication (SIWF & JWT):**
    *   Installed `@farcaster/auth-client`, `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt`, and `viem` dependencies.
    *   Set up secret management for `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` and `AUTH_SECRET` using `.dev.vars` and instructions for Cloudflare secrets.
    *   Implemented the `/api/auth/signin` endpoint using `createAppClient` to verify SIWF messages.
    *   Implemented JWT issuance using `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` upon successful SIWF verification.
    *   Implemented JWT verification middleware (`authMiddleware`) using `verifyToken`.
    *   Refactored all authentication logic into a dedicated module (`api/src/auth.js`).
*   **Durable Objects Setup:**
    *   Configured DO bindings (`SESSION_DO`, `MOCKUP_QUEUE_DO`) in `api/wrangler.toml` including migrations.
    *   Created stub DO classes (`SessionDurableObject`, `MockupQueueDurableObject`) in `api/src/do/`.
    *   Exported DO classes from `api/src/index.js`.
*   **Code Structure:** Refactored `index.js` significantly, moving core logic for seeding and auth into separate modules.

## Blockers

*   None currently.

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 2 - Start Phase 2 Backend)

*   Implement the `GET /api/products?active=true` endpoint:
    *   Query D1 `products` table (status='active').
    *   For each product, query related `product_variants`.
    *   Structure the response as specified in `docs/API_OVERVIEW_PLAN.md`.
*   Implement the `GET /api/products/:id/variants` endpoint:
    *   Query D1 `product_variants` table for the given `product_id`.
    *   Structure the response.
*   Write basic tests or validation checks for these new endpoints.
