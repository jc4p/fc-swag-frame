# CTO Standup - Day 4

**Date:** 2025-05-05 (Assumed)
**Developer:** CTO (Stepping In)

## Summary

Pushed to accelerate multi-product support by integrating Sticker Sheets (Printful ID 505) alongside the existing T-Shirt (ID 586). Successfully modified the backend API and seeding logic to dynamically handle different product types and import the sticker data. However, an attempt to rapidly refactor the frontend `ProductOptions` component to support both single-image (T-shirt) and multi-image (sticker) workflows resulted in significant instability and regressions, breaking core editor functionality. The frontend changes were reverted pending a more structured approach.

## What was done today?

*   **API & Seeding Enhancements (`api/src/seed.js`, `api/src/routes/admin.js`):**
    *   Added a new parameterized admin route `POST /api/admin/import-product/:productId` for importing arbitrary Printful products.
    *   Refactored `seedProductData` function:
        *   Detects product type (e.g., `STICKER`, `T-SHIRT`) from Printful data.
        *   Dynamically selects the correct placement (`default` for stickers, `front` for others) when fetching mockup templates.
        *   Uses the product's default technique key (e.g., `digital` for stickers) for price/availability lookups.
        *   Made variant filtering more robust: correctly handles imports with no `targetColors` specified (imports all variants) and applies size filtering (`S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`) conditionally based on product type (skipped for stickers).
        *   Generates more generic product slugs (e.g., `sticker-505`) for newly imported products.
*   **Sticker Product Import:**
    *   Successfully used the new admin route (`curl ... /api/admin/import-product/505`) to import the Kiss-Cut Sticker Sheet (ID 505) into the database after debugging and resolving initial template/variant fetching issues.
    *   Verified the sticker data is now available via the public `GET /api/products` endpoint.
*   **Frontend Multi-Product Attempt (Reverted):**
    *   Introduced a product selection UI (`ProductSelectorUI`, `ProductSelection`) shown on the main page.
    *   Refactored routing/data flow to fetch all products once and pass the selected product data to the editor component via state/props, avoiding dynamic routes.
    *   Attempted a significant refactor of `ProductOptions.jsx` to handle both:
        *   The existing single-image upload/transform/publish flow for T-shirts.
        *   A new multi-image upload/selection/transform/removal flow specifically for stickers.

## Assessment / Outcome

*   **Backend:** The API and data seeding modifications were successful. The system can now import and represent different product types (T-shirts, Stickers) with their respective template data correctly associated.
*   **Frontend:** The attempt to quickly merge multi-image and single-image logic into the existing `ProductOptions` component proved problematic. The refactor introduced bugs related to state management (`userImages` vs `userImageAttrs`), event handling (`handleStageClick`), image selection (`selectedImageId`), and action handlers (remove image/background), breaking core functionality like image uploading and the general UI layout. **The frontend changes related to the `ProductOptions` refactor have been reverted.** The product selection UI (`ProductSelectorUI`, `ProductSelection`) and the updated data fetching on `page.js` remain as a foundation.

## Blockers

*   **Frontend Complexity:** The `ProductOptions` component requires a more thoughtful architectural approach to cleanly support fundamentally different interaction models (single design placement vs. multiple sticker placements) without breaking existing T-shirt functionality. The quick refactoring attempt was insufficient.

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 5)

*   **Frontend:** Re-evaluate the `ProductOptions` component strategy.
    *   Option 1: Design a more robust internal state management and conditional logic system within `ProductOptions` to handle different `product.type` values gracefully.
    *   Option 2: Consider creating separate editor components (e.g., `TShirtOptions`, `StickerOptions`) loaded conditionally by `ProductOptionsLoader` based on `product.type`.
    *   Prioritize restoring T-shirt functionality within the new selection flow, then build out sticker editor logic.
*   **Backend:** No immediate backend blockers. Monitor frontend needs.
*   **Coordination:** Align with Frontend/Backend devs on the chosen frontend approach.
