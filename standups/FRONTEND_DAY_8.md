# Frontend Day 8 Standup - December 6, 2025

## What I Got Done Today

### Fixed Critical Issues from Yesterday
- **X button functionality**: All product editors now have working back navigation to product selection
- **Sticker sheet square canvas bug**: Fixed component to use correct variant dimensions (1899×2631px) instead of fallback (400×400px)
- **Infinite loop error**: Fixed Kiss-Cut Sticker component dependencies causing "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- **Alert() compatibility**: Replaced all alert() calls with DebugContext logging for Frame compatibility

### Implemented Complete Navigation & Design System
- **Bottom navigation**: Added shared BottomNav component with Home/Create/Profile tabs
- **Page structure**: Migrated current designer to `/create`, created new home page at `/`
- **Design system**: Applied colors, typography, and spacing from HOMEPAGE_STITCH.html
- **Layout system**: Added app container with proper spacing for bottom nav

### Updated Publish Workflow
- **Two-step publishing**: Now calls `POST /api/designs` then `POST /api/designs/:id/publish`
- **Commission integration**: All components pass commission rate to publish endpoints
- **Error handling**: Proper validation for 15-30% royalty range from backend

### Redesigned Create Page
- **Clean UI**: Removed header text, made 2-column product grid
- **Loading states**: Added skeleton loaders and branded loading spinners matching design
- **Product cards**: Image-based selection instead of text buttons
- **Error states**: Consistent error handling with proper iconography

### Performance Optimizations
- **Server-side data**: Products loaded at build/request time
- **Code splitting**: Lazy-loaded product editors with Suspense
- **Shared components**: Reusable LoadingSpinner, BottomNav, etc.

## Current Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Home page with featured products + popular grid (mock data)
- Create page with redesigned product selection
- Profile page with tabs for designs/orders (empty states)
- All product editors: T-shirts, Sticker Sheets, Kiss-Cut Stickers
- Complete navigation between all pages
- Publish workflow with new backend endpoints

## Issues & Todos for Next Sprint

### Missing Product Media (High Priority)
- [ ] **TODO**: Figure out where to get actual product images instead of placeholder URLs from Tailwind design
- Current images are from Googleusercontent links in the design files
- Need real product photos for T-shirts, stickers, etc.

### Feed Integration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **TODO**: Wire up actual loading of published designs in PopularSection
- Backend has empty `/api/feed` endpoint but no published designs yet
- Currently showing mock data with placeholder images
- Need to integrate real feed data once designs are published

### Backend Callout
- **T-shirt colors**: Seeing more color options available than yesterday - is this intentional?
- Yesterday we had limited colors, now seeing full range

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 9)

### Frontend Tasks
- **Feed integration**: Connect PopularSection to real `/api/feed` endpoint
- **Product media**: Source actual product images to replace placeholders
- **Polish**: Fine-tune responsive design and loading states and empty states for home
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing of publish workflow with new endpoints

### Backend Coordination Needed
- **Product images**: Where should we get official product photos?
- **Feed data**: Test feed endpoint once designs are published
- **T-shirt colors**: Confirm if expanded color range is intentional

## Tech Debt Addressed
- Removed all alert() calls for Frame compatibility
- Fixed infinite loops in React components
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Clean component architecture with shared utilities

The app now has complete navigation structure and design system consistency. Main remaining work is content (real images, feed data) rather than infrastructure.
