# Project Manager Standup - Day 4

**Date:** 2025-05-05 (Assumed)
**PM:** AI Assistant (Gemini)

## Overall Status

We are currently at the end of Day 4 of the development cycle.

*   **Schedule:** The project is significantly **ahead of schedule**, particularly on the backend.
*   **Backend:** Completed **Phase 4** (Mockup Generation Prototype, originally planned for Days 9-11). This includes the `/api/designs` endpoint integration with the `MockupQueueDurableObject`, Printful mockup API calls, the `/api/webhooks/printful` handler for callbacks, D1 updates, and WebSocket notifications via `/api/ws` and `SessionDurableObject`. They also addressed frontend needs early by providing template/print area data in Phase 3.
*   **Frontend:** Completed **Phase 3** tasks (Canvas Editor & Design Intake), including integrating Konva.js, handling image uploads/transformations within print boundaries derived from backend data, implementing background removal via a new backend endpoint, and adding the Sign-In-With-Farcaster flow for the publish action. They are currently working on final testing for design submission and planning WebSocket integration for Phase 4.

## Key Accomplishments (End of Day 4)

*   **Backend:** Mockup generation flow (API -> DO -> Printful -> Webhook -> DB -> WebSocket) is implemented. Auth and Product APIs are stable. R2 integration for templates and user images is complete.
*   **Frontend:** Robust canvas editor using Konva is functional, allowing image upload, constrained transformation, and background removal. Product selection and SIWF authentication flow are integrated.

## Assessment vs. Timeline (`docs/DEV_TIMELINE.md`)

*   **Backend:** Completed work planned up to Day 11. **7 days ahead.**
*   **Frontend:** Completed work planned up to Day 8 (Phase 3) and is starting Phase 4 integration. Roughly **on schedule / slightly ahead**, ready to consume backend Phase 4 features.

## Potential Blind Spots / Coordination Needs

1.  **Frontend/Backend Integration:** While the backend is ahead, the frontend is just starting to plan WebSocket integration. We need to ensure close coordination **tomorrow (Day 5)** as the frontend starts consuming the WebSocket endpoint (`/api/ws`) and handling the `mockup_ready` / `mockup_error` events detailed in `BACKEND_DAY_4.md`. Verify the frontend understands the expected message format and flow.
2.  **Error Handling:** Backend reported Printful webhook events include `mockup_task_failed`. Frontend needs to ensure robust handling of the corresponding `mockup_error` WebSocket message, including displaying appropriate user feedback (as outlined in `BACKEND_DAY_4.md`).
3.  **Background Removal Endpoint:** Frontend Day 4 mentions integrating `POST /api/image/remove-background`. This endpoint wasn't explicitly planned in the timeline or mentioned in backend standups. Confirm this was discussed and implemented correctly on the backend side (or if it's a new requirement). *Self-correction: Assuming this was a minor addition discussed offline or part of general API support.*

## Remaining MVP Work (Phases 5 & 6)

*   **Phase 5 (Ordering & Payment Flow - Target Days 12-14):**
    *   Backend: `POST /api/designs/:design_id/publish`, `POST /api/orders`, `GET /api/orders/:id/signature`, `GET /api/feed`. D1 schema updates for publishing/orders.
    *   Frontend: Publishing UI (royalty input), Public Feed/Gallery page (`/api/feed`), Checkout UI (`/api/orders`), display payment signature details.
*   **Phase 6 (Polishing & Extras - Target Days 15-17):**
    *   Both: Testing (E2E, on-chain signature), responsive design tweaks, error handling review, final deployment prep.

## New Scope Request: Hats, Posters, Stickers

*   We received a request to potentially include hats, posters, or stickers in the MVP.
*   **Assessment:**
    *   Printful *does* support these product types, meaning the *fulfillment* side is technically feasible with similar API calls.
    *   However, integrating these would require significant **frontend UI changes**. Each product type has different visualization needs, print area shapes/constraints (e.g., curved surface for hats, different aspect ratios for posters), and potentially different editor tools or previews.
    *   This introduces substantial scope creep beyond the defined MVP (single T-shirt style).
*   **Recommendation:** Defer new product types **post-MVP**. Focus on delivering the core T-shirt flow robustly first. Adding more products can be a fast-follow iteration.

## Plan for Tomorrow (Day 5)

*   **Backend:** Start **Phase 5** work: Implement design publishing endpoint (`POST /api/designs/:design_id/publish`) including schema updates and pricing logic (`API_OVERVIEW_PLAN.md`). Implement public feed (`GET /api/feed`).
*   **Frontend:** Complete design submission testing (`POST /api/designs`). Implement **Phase 4** WebSocket client (`/api/ws`) to listen for and handle mockup notifications (`mockup_ready`, `mockup_error`). Coordinate closely with backend on message format and flow.
*   **PM:** Facilitate frontend/backend coordination on WebSocket integration. Follow up on the background removal endpoint if needed. Reiterate MVP scope regarding new product types.
